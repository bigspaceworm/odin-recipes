# odin-recipes

This website is a project for the Odin Project Foundations Course.

In this project we will apply the knowledge from the HTML Foundations section, which includes the use of tags, text, images, lists, and links. We're also using Git, so we're also practicing when to commit and how to write good commit messages.
